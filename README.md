# Legacy AI Support – MCP-Driven Integration for Legacy Systems

## 1. Overview

### 1.1. Project Title
**Legacy AI Enhancement – Modernizing Legacy Systems with MCP Servers**

### 1.2. Problem Statement
Many enterprises rely on legacy systems that suffer from outdated documentation, manual troubleshooting, and inefficient support processes. Modernizing these systems entirely is often impractical, so enhancing them with AI capabilities is the best path forward.

### 1.3. Objective
Integrate AI-driven features into legacy systems via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to:
- Automate documentation and code analysis.
- Enhance support through intelligent ticket triage and conversational AI.
- Proactively monitor and diagnose system issues.
- Leverage existing legacy data without a complete overhaul.

## 2. Proposed Solution

### 2.1. Key Components

- **MCP Servers:**  
  Modularly integrate AI capabilities using various MCP servers:
  - *Filesystem MCP:* Access and monitor project files/logs.
  - *Git/GitHub MCP:* Analyze code changes and generate documentation.
  - *Memory MCP:* Persist historical context from support interactions.
  - *Analytics MCP:* Monitor system health and error logs.
  - *Chat/Support MCP:* Enable conversational support (integrated with Slack/Teams).

- **Central Dashboard UI:**  
  A web-based dashboard that aggregates data from the MCP servers, displays real-time metrics, and allows users to interact with AI tools (e.g., an “echo” tool or code analysis).

- **Express Backend:**  
  A Node.js/Express server that acts as the intermediary between the dashboard UI and the MCP servers.

### 2.2. Workflow Diagram (High-Level)
1. **User Interaction:**  
   - The user enters a query or selects an option on the dashboard.
2. **API Request:**  
   - The dashboard sends a request to the Express backend.
3. **MCP Server Call:**  
   - The backend forwards the request to a running MCP server (e.g., an echo tool or documentation generator).
4. **Response Processing:**  
   - The MCP server processes the request and returns a result.
5. **UI Update:**  
   - The backend sends the result back to the UI for display.

### 2.3. Use Cases
- **Automated Code Analysis & Documentation:**  
  Analyze legacy code via Git/GitHub MCP servers and auto-generate context-rich documentation.
- **AI-Driven Support Ticket Triage:**  
  Integrate with legacy support systems to automatically prioritize and respond to support tickets.
- **Real-Time Monitoring & Diagnostics:**  
  Continuously monitor logs and system metrics, triggering AI-generated alerts and recommendations.
- **Conversational Assistance:**  
  Use a chat interface powered by an AI module to offer 24/7 support and troubleshooting.

## 3. Detailed Implementation Plan (Proof-of-Concept)

### 3.1. Environment Setup

- **Prerequisites:**
  - Install the latest Node.js and NPM.
  - Familiarity with JavaScript, Node.js, and basic web development.
  - Access to a terminal/command prompt and VS Code.
  
- **MCP Server Setup:**
  - For the PoC, use a reference MCP server (e.g., the “Everything” server).  
    In a terminal, run:
    ```bash
    npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-everything
    ```
    *(Configure it to run on a designated port, e.g., 4000.)*
  
- **Initialize PoC Project:**
  - Create a new project directory and initialize with NPM:
    ```bash
    mkdir legacy-ai-dashboard
    cd legacy-ai-dashboard
    npm init -y
    npm install express axios
    ```

### 3.2. Building the Express Backend

Create a file named `server.js` with the following content:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

// Middleware to parse JSON and serve static files
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

// Endpoint for an example "echo" tool via MCP server
app.post('/api/tool/echo', async (req, res) => {
  const { message } = req.body;
  try {
    // Forward the request to the MCP echo tool running on port 4000
    const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:4000/echo', { message });
    res.json(response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('MCP server error:', error.message);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Error calling MCP server' });
  }
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Express server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
