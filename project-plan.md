# AI-Driven Modernization POC for Java Microservices & Serverless

**Version**: 2.0  

This document outlines the overall project approach, including scope, high-level architecture, and validation strategies for organizations beginning their AI journey. **Note that this is an adaptive learning plan** designed to be flexible as we collaborate and discover what works best for your specific environment.

---

## 1) Project Summary

We aim to enhance an existing Java microservices + serverless environment with AI-driven capabilities—such as automated documentation, anomaly detection, and predictive scaling—by introducing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) adapter and a real-time analytics layer.

### Key Objectives
1. **Reduce Manual Documentation** – By auto-generating system references for microservices and serverless components.
2. **Boost Observability** – Unify logs from Cloudflare, AWS, and Java microservices into a single view.
3. **Improve Incident Response** – Leverage AI analytics to detect anomalies early and provide runbook suggestions.
4. **Build AI Familiarity** – Introduce AI concepts gradually to build organizational understanding and confidence.

## 2) Project Scope & Deliverables
- **In-Scope**
  - Creating an MCP adapter to gather and normalize logs/metrics.
  - Building an AI/analytics layer for real-time anomaly detection.
  - Providing visualization tools to present insights effectively.
  - Educational workshops to build AI literacy within your organization.

## 4) AI Use Cases Evaluation & Selection

After evaluating multiple potential use cases for AI integration, we've prioritized them based on feasibility, impact, and alignment with current business needs:

### 4.1 Potential Use Cases Considered
| Use Case | Description | Feasibility | Business Impact | Selected |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Anomaly Detection** | Identify unusual patterns in service performance, traffic, or resource usage | High | High | ✅ |
| **Predictive Scaling** | Anticipate resource needs before traffic spikes occur | Medium | High | Planned for Future |
| **Automated Documentation** | Generate & maintain technical documentation from code and logs | High | Medium | ✅ |
| **Incident Classification** | Auto-categorize alerts and suggest response priority | Medium | Medium | Planned for Future |
| **Root Cause Analysis** | Identify likely sources of failures or performance issues | Low | High | Future Consideration |
| **Security Threat Detection** | Identify potential security breaches or unusual access patterns | Low | High | Future Consideration |
| **Cost Optimization** | Suggest resource allocation changes to reduce cloud costs | Medium | Medium | Future Consideration |

### 4.2 Primary Use Case: Real-time Anomaly Detection & Insights

For this POC, we've selected **Real-time Anomaly Detection & Insights** as our primary use case due to its:

1. **Immediate Value**: It addresses the pressing issue of correlating scattered logs and detecting issues before they impact users
2. **Technical Feasibility**: We can implement this with existing log data and modern ML algorithms
3. **Measurable Impact**: Success can be quantified through metrics like Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) and false positive rates
4. **Educational Value**: Provides a clear demonstration of AI capabilities in a familiar context

The selected use case will:
- Unify logs from Java microservices, AWS Lambda, and Cloudflare
- Apply machine learning to detect anomalies in real-time
- Generate contextual alerts with suggested mitigation steps
- Build a feedback loop to improve detection accuracy over time

**Secondary Use Case**: We will also implement **Automated Documentation** as it complements our primary use case with relatively low additional effort.
